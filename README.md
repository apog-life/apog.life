5. Why is APOG?

	The concept of APOG originated while a group extremely chill friends found themselves so thoroughly enjoying their camping experience at a festival, they posed the question: “Why this event? We could literally do this on any patch of grass (APOG).”

	As they reflected on their experiences hosting many large events, it became clear: this group is capable of some serious good vibe curating. In an effort to share our unique flavor of awesome with the world, we are hosting an event that will be shaped by you! 

5. How do I participate?

	Step 1: Add yourself the the mailing list. You will be informed as ticket sales become available.

	Step 2: Get involved. We want everyone who joins APOG to feel empowered and encouraged to be active participants of the event. For more information, see below:
  
6. How do I get involved?

	APOG is all about you! We are looking for people who want to build art, lead activities, give performances, help coordinate, or contribute other fun ideas.

      Types of involvement:
  
	- Performer: Got a song you want to share? Or a whole set? We will have stages with amplified sound and want to create a line-up with you on it!
	- Leader: Have a fun class you want to teach or want to coordinate a game? We will have time reserved for events and we have a big list of ideas if you are looking for some direction!
	- Artist: Have something cool to share or want to build something interactive? We want to feature it at APOG!
	- Event Personnel: Want to show up early and set-up or be a part of the core planning team? Bring it!
	- Other: Not listed above? Let us know!

8. How much will a ticket cost?
	
	Prices pending RSVPs. Goal: less than $150.

9. What should I bring?

	Think: Car Camping. The event will not be providing food, water, or any other consumables. You should have access to your vehicle but it may not be convenient. There will be outhouses and some basic trash/recycling for the event. In general, the closer to a “pack in, pack out” approach, the better.

10. What should I NOT bring?	

	A bad attitude.

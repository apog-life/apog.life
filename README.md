5. Why is APOG?

	The concept of APOG originated while a group extremely chill friends found themselves so thoroughly enjoying their camping experience at a festival, they posed the question: ‘Why this event? We could literally do this on any patch of grass (APOG).’

	As they reflected on their experiences hosting many large events, it became clear: this group is capable of some serious good vibe crafting. In an effort to share our unique flavor of awesome with the world, we are hosting an event that will be shaped by you!

6. How do I get involved?

	APOG is all about you! We are looking for people who want to build art, lead activities, perform, help coordinate, or contribute their ideas.

	Types of involvement:

	- Performer: Got a song you want to share? Or a whole set? We will have stages with amplified sound and want to create a line-up with you on it!
	- Leader: Have a fun class you want to teach or want to coordinate a game? We will have time reserved for events and we have a big list of ideas if you are looking for some direction!
	- Artist: Have something cool to share or want to build something interactive? We want to feature it at APOG!

	Pricing will be determined in part by RSVP’s, but our goal is to keep tickets below $150.  Help us keep ticket costs down by inviting more awesome people like you!

9. What should I bring?

	Think: Car Camping. The event will not be providing food, water, or any other consumables. You will have access to your vehicle but it may not be convenient. There will be bathrooms and some trash/recycling available on site, but this will be a leave-no-trace pack-it-in/pack-it-out event.

10. What should I NOT bring?

	A bad attitude.
